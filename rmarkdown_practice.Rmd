**CDS 101 is Awesome!**

# **CDS-101-K02**
**CDS-101-K02 001**

# **Course Goal**
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Use [GitHub](www.github.com) for creating a reproducible research document.

    - My GitHub username is:*Ian Baranda*
    
* Obtain, clean, transform, and visualize a dataset using the R programming language.

* Interpret and predict dataset trends using statistical inference and models.

* Critically examine and interpret statistical claims reported in mass media.

# **Including Code**

## **Running R code in a code chunk**

```{r}
x <- 2+2
x+3
```

The output of first line of code is not printed out because it is assigned to a variable instead.

The second line of output is printed out instead, but this means that the calculated value has notbeen saved for future use.

## **Displaying Graphs**

```{r}
ggplot2::qplot(data = iris, x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)
```
